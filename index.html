          <p>
              I'm passionate about solving challenging and impactful problems,
              especially those that would help bring equity of access and
              education to disadvantaged and underprivileged groups of people.
              Currently I do that by writing code!
          </p>
          <p>
              I'm currently a software developer at Offerpop, where we create
              solutions to fit the needs of the social media marketer. I've been
              fortunate to work on a project using Django, MySQL, MongoDB,
              Angular, and Elasticsearch which aggregates data from multiple
              internal resources and external APIs to present a composite
              reporting dashboard which combines an individual's separate social
              media identities into one user profile. Currently I work on a
              different project using a micro-services architecture with a Flask
              back-end, and React/Flux front-end.
          </p>
          <p>
              I completed App Academy in March 2014 where we learned Ruby, the
              Ruby on Rails web framework, PostgreSQL, and Backbone.js, but my
              first experience in the web started in middle school. The advent
              of personalized social media pages sparked my curiosity and I
              began to learn everything I could about CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
              in order to make my personal space on the web feel like my own.
          </p>
          <p>
              I'm an advocate for bringing visibility to underrepresented
              groups, especially in the tech industry. I'm currently working on
              a project which aims to standardize corporate diversity reporting,
              incorporating a broader view of identity that goes beyond
              race/ethnicity and gender.
          </p>
          <p>
              In the long run, I'm looking to work on fully distributed teams
              which aim to make global impact in areas like civil and human
              rights, access to education, public health, workplace diversity,
              and poverty alleviation.
